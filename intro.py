# Machine learning introduction
# Move from regression to deep learning with TensorFlow
# Plan: Basics first, let's hit the concepts and the core ML algorithms
# From there, we'll move to implementation, demonstrate with scikit-learn
# Finally, we'll use outside tools, TensorFlow, AWS, to implement and
# Use ML algorithms, connect to and deploy APIs
# Stick to it! Will need sk-learn, quandl, pandas to start
